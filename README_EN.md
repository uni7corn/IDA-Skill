# IDA Skill for AI Agent

English | [中文](README.md)

> 🤖 Enable AI Agents to analyze malware like security analysts

## What is this?

This is an **AI Agent skill** that enables AI to automatically analyze malware using IDA Pro, just like human security analysts:

- 🔍 **Automatic Malicious Behavior Detection** - Analyze C2 communication, process injection, persistence mechanisms, and malicious behaviors
- 🧩 **Understand Code Functionality** - Automatically analyze function logic, identify encryption algorithms, and trace data flows
- 📊 **Extract Key Information** - Import tables, strings, opcode features, YARA rules
- 🎯 **Locate Threat Indicators** - IP addresses, domains, file paths, registry keys

## Demo Video

Demonstration using my multi-agent framework Spore: Since the video embedded in the readme file failed to upload, please download movie.mp4.

## How to Use?

**Super simple! Just 3 steps:**

### 1️⃣ Configure IDA Path

Edit `config.json`:

```json
{
  "idat_path": "C:/Program Files/IDA Pro 9.0/idat64.exe"
}
```

### 2️⃣ Let AI Agent Use the Skill

Simply place the IDA Skill in your skill folder.

### 3️⃣ Start Analysis

AI Agent will automatically:
- Initialize IDA database
- Extract import tables, strings, decompiled code
- Perform reverse analysis like a human
- Analyze functionality and extract C2
- Identify encryption algorithms and suspicious behaviors
- Generate analysis reports

**That's it!** 🎉

## Built-in Tools

This skill package integrates multiple powerful analysis tools that the Agent will automatically invoke:

### 🤖 REAI - AI Function Analysis

> Based on my open-source project [REAI](https://github.com/miunasu/REAI_IDA)

**Features:** Use LLM to automatically understand function functionality and recursively analyze call chains
- Automatically identify function purposes (e.g., "decrypt config", "connect to C2")
- Automatically rename functions (`sub_401000` → `AI_decrypt_config`)
- Add comments at call sites explaining sub-function purposes

**Configuration:** Edit `tools/reai.py` to set your LLM API

```python
API_KEY = "sk-..."           # Your API key
API_URL = "https://..."      # API endpoint (supports OpenAI/Azure/DeepSeek/local models)
MODEL = "gpt-4"              # Model name
```

### 🔍 FindCrypt - Cryptographic Algorithm Detection

> Based on the open-source FindCrypt project

**Features:** Automatically detect cryptographic constants in code
- Supported algorithms: AES, DES, RC4, Blowfish, TEA
- Supported hashes: MD5, SHA1, SHA256
- Supported encodings: Base64, CRC32

---

### 📝 mkYARA - YARA Rule Generation

> Based on the open-source mkYARA project

**Features:** Generate threat detection rules from code snippets
- Support multiple matching modes (strict/normal/loose)
- Automatically extract signature code
- Generate YARA rules for threat detection

---

### 📊 Export Check - Export Table Analysis

**Features:** Detect abnormal DLL export functions
- Analyze export function sizes
- Identify abnormal export patterns

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to know IDAPython?

A: **No!** Just let the AI Agent read `SKILL.md`, and the Agent will automatically use these tools. You only need to describe your requirements in natural language.
